## Modules in Development and Next Steps

<div class="alert alert--info">
  <strong>Full transparency:</strong> We are transparent about our progress. The following modules and distributions are our priority to reach version 1.0:
</div>

### 📦 Complete Inventory Module
Although the backend endpoints are ready, the next step is to connect the user interface to allow for complete management of products, supplies, suppliers, and recipes with automatic stock deduction.

### 🌐 Web Point of Sale with NWC
We are working on a web interface that will allow generating Lightning invoices through a **Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC)** connection in read-only mode. This will facilitate Bitcoin payments from any device.

### 🖨️ Integration with Thermal Printers
A POS system is not complete without the ability to print. The development of the SDK and drivers for the physical printing of kitchen and customer tickets is a critical milestone.

### 🧪 Public Beta Release
Once the key features are stabilized, we will launch a Beta version to receive feedback from the community and polish the user experience.

### 📥 Simplified Installers
To facilitate the adoption of the system, we are developing:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col col--6">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card__header">
        <h4>🐧 Linux</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="card__body">
        <p>A <strong>single installation script for Linux</strong> that will automate the entire configuration process.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col col--6">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card__header">
        <h4>🪟 Windows</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="card__body">
        <p>A <strong>Windows installer</strong> that will allow for quick and easy implementation in the most common environments.</p>
      </div>
