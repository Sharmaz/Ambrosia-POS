## About Me

I am a self-taught full-stack developer specializing in the **.NET**, **MERN**, and **PERN** ecosystems. I am passionate about building useful and ethical software, particularly in the payments and Bitcoin sector. I have worked on integrating systems with **Phoenixd** and **MongoDB**, deploying services in lightweight **Linux** environments like **Alpine** and **Debian** on **Raspberry Pi**. I actively participate in technology communities and hackerspaces, where I promote the use of open technologies.
