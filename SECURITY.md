# Security Policy

## Active Development

Ambrosia POS is currently in an active development phase. We greatly appreciate the community's support in keeping our project secure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At this moment, due to the early stage of the project, we ask that you report any security vulnerabilities privately via email to:

**jordi77alva@gmail.com**

We are committed to investigating all reports and will do our best to address any issues promptly.

A more formal vulnerability reporting process will be established in the future. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in helping us keep Ambrosia POS secure.
